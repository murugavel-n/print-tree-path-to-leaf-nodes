## hasLeftOrRightNode
This function checks if the given node has left or right node and returns boolean value

## isLeafNode
This function checks if the given node is the leaf node of the tree and returns boolean value

## isVisitedPath
This function checks if the given path is already visited while preparing the path to leaf node and returns boolean value

## printPathsToLeafNode
This function iterates over the paths to leaf node and prints the path in the browser/node console
